Software Engineering Tasks
1. Problem Analysis and High-Level Requirements
Utilizing best practices in requirements elicitation and iterative development, perform a problem analysis and capture high-level requirements. This information will be saved in a Requirements Specification Document (SRS). See the SRS Template for detailed requirements.

2. Requirements Model Engineering and Use Case Specification
Identify goals, actors, and high-level tasks. Perform scenario modeling and group scenarios to identify essential use cases. Create Use Case Diagrams with actors and use cases. For each identified use case, fill out the Use Case Specification (Description) Template, documenting all specifications in MS Word.

3. UML Use Case Diagrams
Draw UML Use Case Diagrams using a UML modeling tool or by hand. Document all UML Use Case Diagrams in MS Word.

4. Brainstorming and Class Diagrams
Brainstorm a list of object candidates necessary for the solution. Identify data and methods supported by the object candidates. Create a set of class diagrams documenting classes and their relationships.

5. Sequence Diagrams
Develop sequence diagrams based on the flow identified at the Use Case and CRC level between objects. Represent the flow of control from given actors and their execution of identified methods.

Submission
Combine all documents into a single submission, including:

SRS Document (Step 1)
Use Case Specification Document (Step 2)
UML Use Case Diagrams Document (Step 3)
Class Diagrams (Step 5)
Sequence Diagrams (Step 6)
Ensure that your submission is original work, and upload it to Canvas before the specified due date and time. No unoriginal work will be accepted.
